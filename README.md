Sharks and Minnows game for ME35 Fall 2024:

On game day, each team will be assigned a role - Shark or Minnow.  Then we will place all the robots in a different room and the minnows have 5 min to drive from the edge of the playing field into the Safe Zone in the middle of the field.  The Sharks try to block them.  There are a few caveats:

1) you will not be able see your car - but you can see through your phone (that is riding on the car) by zooming in.  So you must navigate from the viewpoint of your car.
2) you must start your car with a Thumbs Up and stop it with a Open Palm using teachable machines.
3) Your car must contain at least two motors, each controlled by a separate Pico (but you can use just one motor controller board).
4) You must drive your car by having the OpenMV camera read different April Tags (for example, one means straight, another left, etc).
